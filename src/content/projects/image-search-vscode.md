# **Air Quality Monitoring with Raspberry Pi Zero: A DIY Guide**

Air quality is an important factor in our health and well-being, yet many of us are unaware of the pollutants we breathe daily. With advancements in affordable electronics like the Raspberry Pi Zero, building your own air quality monitoring system is now easier than ever. In this blog post, we’ll walk you through the process of creating a DIY air quality monitor using the Raspberry Pi Zero and various sensors.

## **Why Monitor Air Quality?**

Poor air quality can result from pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These pollutants can lead to health issues such as respiratory problems, allergies, and long-term chronic conditions. By monitoring air quality, you can take steps to improve indoor environments and raise awareness about outdoor pollution levels.

## **What You’ll Need**

Here’s the list of components required for this project:

### **Hardware**

1. **Raspberry Pi Zero** (or Pi Zero W for Wi-Fi connectivity)
2. **MicroSD card** (8GB or larger)
3. **Air quality sensors**:
   - **PMS5003** or **SDS011** for particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10)
   - **MQ-135** for gases like CO2 and VOCs
   - **DHT22** for temperature and humidity monitoring (optional)
4. **USB to micro-USB adapter**
5. **Power supply** (5V, 2A)
6. **Jumper wires and breadboard**

### **Software**

1. **Raspberry Pi OS Lite** (or any lightweight Linux distribution)
2. **Python** with libraries like `pms5003`, `Adafruit_DHT`, and `matplotlib`
3. **Data visualization tools** (e.g., ThingSpeak or Grafana for remote dashboards)

## **Step-by-Step Instructions**

### **Step 1: Set Up Raspberry Pi Zero**

1. Flash the Raspberry Pi OS Lite onto the microSD card using a tool like Balena Etcher.
2. Insert the SD card into the Pi Zero and power it on.
3. Connect to the Pi via SSH or a display to configure the basics:
   ```bash
   sudo raspi-config
   ```
